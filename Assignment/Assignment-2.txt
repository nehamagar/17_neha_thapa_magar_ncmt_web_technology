1 Define the term “sitemap” in the planning phase. 
-In the planning phase “sitemap” is the blueprint or diagram that outline the structure of a project. 

2 What is the purpose of the “Launch” phase in web development. 
-The purpose of the “Launch” phase in web development is to ensure a smooth, error-free transitions. 

3 Why is “Documentation” important in the development lifecycle? 
-Documentation is important in the development lifecycle  because it ensures that the project remains understandable, maintainable and scalable. 

4 Differentiate between Front-end and Back-end development. 
- The front-end is the part of the website that users see in their browser whereas the back-end consists of the server, the application logic, and the database.

5 “Planning is the most critical phase of web development.” Discuss this statement by listing the key activities performed during the planning phase. 
-Planning is the most critical phase of web development because the planning stage serves as the foundation for the entire project. The Key activities performed during the planning phase are:  
I) Requirement Gathering and Analysis: Before a single line of code is written, stakeholders must identify the website's goals. 
II) Sitemap Creation: This involves building the structural hierarchy of the website. It ensures that the information architecture is logical and that users can find what they need in as few clicks as possible. 
III) Wire Framing: Wireframes are skeletal blueprints of individual pages. They don't include colors or images; instead, they focus on the placement of elements like buttons, headers, and content blocks. 
IV) Technology Stack Selection: The team decides which tools are best suited for the project's specific goal. 
V) Project Scheduling and Resource Allocation: A roadmap is created to define the timeline. 
VI) Budgeting and Risk assessment: The team estimates the total cost (development hours, server costs, third-party API fees) and identifies potential "showstoppers," such as security vulnerabilities or integration hurdles with existing company software. 

 6 Explain the iterative nature of the maintenance phase. Why is a website never truly “Finished”. 
- The iterative nature of the maintenance phase refers to the fact that it is a continuous loop rather than a final destination. In software development, maintenance is the "Evolutionary Phase" where the product is constantly refined based on real-world usage. 
A website is never truly finished because it exists in a state of dynamic tension with its environment. This is driven by three types of iterative maintenance: 
Corrective: Fixing "bugs" that only appear once thousands of real users start clicking on things in ways the developers didn't anticipate. 
Adaptive: Updating the site because the "outside world" changed—such as a new version of iOS, a Chrome browser update, or new privacy laws (like GDPR). 
Perfective: Making the site better even if it isn't "broken." This involves using data (like Google Analytics) to realize a button should be a different color or a checkout process should be shorter to increase sales. 

7 Describe the process of “Information Gathering.” Why is Understanding the target audience critical during this step? 
- Information Gathering is the initial discovery phase of the web development lifecycle. It is a research-intensive process where developers and stakeholders define the project's "DNA." Instead of focusing on how the site will look, this phase focuses on why the site exists and what it needs to achieve. Understanding the target audience critical during this step because: 
i)It dictates the user interface. 
ii)It determines the content strategy. 
iii) It shapes the functionality. 
iv) It improves conversion rate.

8 You are the project manager for a new e-commerce site. The client wants to skip the “Testing” phase to save money and launch early. Write a persuasive argument explaining the potential risks (security, functionality, compatibility) of skipping this phase. 
-As a project manager, I strongly advise client not skipping the “Testing” phase to save money and launch early. Testing is not an optional step; it protects the business, users from serious risk that can cost far more after launch. 
i) Security Risks: Without proper testing, the e-commerce site may contain security vulnerabilities such as weak authentication, insecure payment processing, or exposure of customer data. Hackers often target newly launched websites, especially online stores that handle personal and financial information. A single security breach can lead to loss of customer trust, legal penalties, financial loss, and long-term damage to the company’s reputation. Fixing security issues after an attack is far more expensive than preventing them through testing. 
ii) Functionality Risks: Testing ensures that all features—such as product search, add-to-cart, checkout, payment, and order confirmation—work correctly. If testing is skipped, users may face issues like failed payments, incorrect pricing, broken links, or lost orders. These problems directly impact sales and customer satisfaction. Customers who experience errors are unlikely to return, leading to immediate revenue loss and negative reviews. 
iii) Compatibility and Performance Risks: E-commerce users access the site from different devices, browsers, and operating systems (mobile phones, tablets, Chrome, Safari, etc.). Without testing, the website may work on some platforms but fail on others. Pages may load slowly, layouts may break on mobile devices, or features may not function properly. This can result in abandoned carts and loss of a large portion of potential customers. 

9 A developer begins coding a website immediately after meeting the client, without creating design prototype or sitemap. Midway through, the client rejects the layout. Analyze what went wrong in the process and how it should have been handled. 
- The main problem was that the developer skipped the planning and design phase. By starting coding immediately after meeting the client, the developer made assumptions about the website’s structure, layout, and user experience without getting clear approval. Without a design prototype (wireframe/mockup) or a sitemap, the client had no visual or structural reference to review. As a result, misunderstandings occurred, and the developer built a layout that did not match the client’s expectations. This led to wasted time, rework, increased cost, and frustration for both sides when the client rejected the design midway.  
The process should have followed a structured approach: 
Requirement Approach: The developer should first gather detailed requirements from the client, including goals, target users, preferred style, and functionality. 
Sitemap creation: A sitemap should have been created to define the website’s structure and navigation. This helps the client understand how pages are organized. 
Design prototype: Before coding, the developer should prepare wireframes or visual mockups showing the layout, colors, and user flow. The client should review and approve these designs. 
Client approval: Development should only begin after the client formally approves the sitemap and prototype. This ensures alignment and reduces the risk of major changes later. 
Development and Testing: Once approved, the developer can code with confidence, followed by testing to ensure quality. 

10  A university website was launched successfully, but after six months, students stopped visiting it because the exam schedules were outdated. Which phase of the development lifecycle was neglected? Explain the activities involved in this phase. 
- The website was launched successfully, which means the earlier phases such as planning, design, development, testing, and deployment were completed properly. However, after six months, students stopped visiting the website because the exam schedules were outdated. This indicates that the website content was not regularly updated or managed, which is the responsibility of the Maintenance phase. 
The activities involved in this phase are: 
Content Updates: Regularly updating information such as exam schedules, notices, academic calendars, and announcements to ensure accuracy. 
Bug Fixes: Identifying and fixing errors or issues that appear after the website is live. 
Performance Monitoring: Checking website speed, uptime, and functionality to ensure smooth user experience. 
Security Updates: Applying patches and updates to protect the website from security threats and vulnerabilities. 
Enhancement and Improvements: Adding new features or improving existing ones based on user feedback and changing requirements.                                                                 Group-A
